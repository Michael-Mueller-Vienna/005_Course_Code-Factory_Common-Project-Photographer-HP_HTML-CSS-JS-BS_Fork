                <p>We worked with them this past December for our London-based event. They are wonderful photographers to work with and extremely professional. There was a small problem on the day of shooting, but they fixed it very well. The problem was that they were not on time on the day of shooting but later they apologize for not living up to our usual standards and offer us Discount for next event. </p>
